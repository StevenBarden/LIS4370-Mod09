# LIS4370-Mod09

Demonstrate three types of data visualizations using the mtcars dataset.

For Module 9 of LIS-4370, I used the `mtcars` dataset to compare Base R, Lattice, and ggplot2 by plotting MPG against horsepower, grouping by cylinders for the last two. I found Base R quick but basic, Lattice handy for grouped data despite its clunky syntax, and ggplot2 the best for its flexibility and sharp visuals. The R script and plots are in this repo, with a full write-up on my blog. It was a fun way to see how each method handles data viz!
